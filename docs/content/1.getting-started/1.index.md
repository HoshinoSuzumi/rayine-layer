description: Multi-purpose customizable components for RayineSoft projects
---

RayineUI is a multi-purpose customizable UI library for RayineSoft projects.

This project aims to facilitate sharing a component library across multiple projects for my own use. Open-sourcing it is just a bonus. Therefore, I am under no obligation to meet your requirements, and breaking changes may occur at any time. Of course, pull requests are welcome.

## Features

- Fully customizable components
- TailwindCSS inside
- Full TypeScript support
